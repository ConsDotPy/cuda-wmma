# CUDA Introduction
This is a simple introduction practices to CUDA, the goal is to learn the basic concepts of CUDA and how to use it. It is based on the fundamental calculation in neural networks, the weighted matrix multiplication algorithm. The code is written in C++ and CUDA C. The code was tested on a NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU.

It is not intended to be a comprehensive guide to CUDA. For that, please see the [CUDA C Programming Guide](http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html).
